I made this game with my friend my junior year of high school. 
We are not sure why the name is what it is but we just wanted something funny so we themed our whole game around the name HP Office Jet Pro
The full name of the game is HP OFFICE JET PRO 6973 WIRELESS ALL-IN-ONE INSTANT INK READY PRINTER
You are a spider trapped in a printer
Your goal is to avoid the Ink and take out all the ink cartridge bosses
Movement is arrow keys and spacebar will clear the screen of all ink
Boss health is on the left and player health is on the right
Enjoy
